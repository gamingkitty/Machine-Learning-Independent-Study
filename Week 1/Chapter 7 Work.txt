1. Write code that plots the linear regression for a set of data points.
2. Use what you learned to derive code for an nth degree polynomial regression for a set of data points (in the form m_n * x_n + m_n-1 * x_n-1 + ... + m_1 * x + m_0 * b)
(Optional: make the points draggable so you can see the regression update in real time!)

3. Write code to find the minimum distance between two lines in R^n.
