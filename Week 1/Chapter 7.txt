This chapter covers the applications of finding projections and orthogonal bases.

By the end of the chapter you should know the following:

1. How to calculate the orthogonal bases of a subspace in R^n
2. How to calculate a projection onto a subspace
3. How to find a line of best fit given n data points
4. Find the distance between two lines
