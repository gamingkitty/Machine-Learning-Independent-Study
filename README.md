# Machine Learning Independent Study

## Introduction
This is an independent study on machine learning and computer vision that focuses heavily on the mathematics behind them.
It combines two courses from Standford: Math 51 and CS 231.

While doing this independent study, you will gain a deep understanding of the mathematics behind neural networks and get the chance to build your own from scratch.

## Curriculum
**Week 1**: You will learn how to compute the orthogonal bases of subspaces and various applications of projections.

Projects:
- Linear and polynomial regression using linear algebra
- Distance between two lines

**Week 2**:
Neural Networks
